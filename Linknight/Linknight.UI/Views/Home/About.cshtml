                Here at Linknight, we link friends and family together through the ability to share and connect with one another. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began, it has become much more difficult – if not impossible for some – to go over and watch videos with your friends. Through our website, we hope to remedy that and bring about some of that togetherness without the hassle or worry of travel.
